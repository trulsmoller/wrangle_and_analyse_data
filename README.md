### Project Title
Wrangle and Analyse Data

### Description
This is the fourth project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

This project focuses on the Data Wrangling part of the process. Data is gathered from three different sources and file types and compiled to a tidy and clean pandas DataFrame, which again is explored and visualized in a Jupyter Notebook 'wrangle_act'. Then one wrangle_report and one act_report is produced.

### Files used
